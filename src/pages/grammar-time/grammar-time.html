                    For English speakers, as well as speakers of most European languages would know that the sentence structure of those languages is mainly.
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                  Subject – Verb – Object
                </p>
                <p class="example-italic-text">
                  I am a man.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

                <p>
                  In Tagalog however, one needs to become accustomed to the structure when he/she practises the language. The sentence structure is not unique however strange to native English speakers. These are the most common structures in Tagalog:
                </p>

                <p class="example-text">
                  Verb – Subject – Object 
                </p>
                <p class="example-italic-text">or</p>
                <p class="example-text">
                  Verb – Object – Subject
                </p>

                <p>As you can see, the verb goes before either the object or the subject. This form is common in speech. Let’s analyse some examples:</p>

                <p class="example-text">
                  Lalaki si Juan → Juan is male
                </p>

                <p class="text-light">
                  NOTE: There is no “to be” word but we’ll discuss this later. Here are some examples with verbs.
                </p>

                <p class="example-italic-text">
                  Kumain (ate) ang aso (dog) ng buto (bone)  →  The dog ate a bone.
                </p>
                <p class="example-italic-text">
                  Nakita (saw) ko (I) siya (him/her) → I saw him/her.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="lesson-box">
            <!-- <h3>Classification & Terminology</h3> -->
              <div class="lesson-content">
                <div class="lesson-text">
  
                    <p class="example-text">
                      Subject – Verb – Object
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This is another structure common in the language where the subject goes before the verb. Usually, this form is considered formal.
                    </p>

                    <p class="example-italic-text">
                      Si Juan ay lalaki → Juan is male
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Notice that unlike the VSO example (Lalaki si Juan), the SVO example has the word “ay” between the subject and the object. Ay is a particle in a sentence that can be used as either a copula, linking verb, “to be” verb or an equal sign. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some sources may say that the particle is not a copula or a linking verb but like the “=”. If it makes things easy for you, you can try using it as the verb “to be” in SVO sentences. One of the reasons why the particle is not considered a verb because it can be in a sentence with other verbs. Ay is also not considered an auxiliary verb.
                    </p>

                    <p class="example-italic-text">
                      Ang aso ay kumain ng buto  →  The dog ate a bone.
                    </p>
