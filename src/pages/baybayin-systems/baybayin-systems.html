                      It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century.

                   <p>
                    In upland areas and remote villages that were difficult for colonizers to reach, some scripts remained intact. There are only two places left in the Philippines that have preserved their ancient syllabic scripts: Mindoro, where the Hanunó'o-Mangyan and the Buhid-Mangyan simply call their scripts “Surat Mangyan,” and Palawan, where the Tagbanua and Pala’wan groups share a writing system they simply call “surat” — a word meaning “writing.” Some ethnolinguists and advocates argue that “suyat” and “surat” are the best neutral term to use as a general descriptor of our writing systems.

                   <p>
                    Meanwhile, small groups around the country are making initiatives to popularize scripts that are no longer in use, like the Kulitan script of the Kapampangans.

                    The Northern Script of the Hanunó'o Mangyan and the Southern Script of the Northern Buhid remain in existence today likely due to the Mangyan’s relative isolation in the mountains of Mindoro. Dutch anthropologist Antoon Postma, who lived with the Hanunó'o Mangyan for many years, is also credited for helping document and preserve their scripts.

                    These scripts are traditionally engraved on bamboo with the use of a small pocket knife, and can also be found on wooden objects like tobacco containers, lime containers, house beams, and musical instruments, which are used to accompany the incantation of traditional poems written in the scripts: the ambahan and urukay.

                   <p>
                    The script is believed to have originated among the Tagbanua people, who then introduced the writing to the Pala’wan when Tagbanua workers were taken to Brooke’s Point in Palawan before the second world war. Both groups are said to have recalled the use of their script in relaying messages and asking for basic goods from friends and family in far off places, as well as in signing legal documents, casting their vote during local, provincial, and national elections, and in writing ownership on animals and trees.

                   <p>
                    Among the other scripts that are being revived by small groups and movements, Kulitan is one of the most interesting scripts, for it is steeped in mythology. In Michael Raymon M. Pangilinan’s book, “An Introduction to Kulitan, The Indigenous Kapampangan Script,” he says the script is written top to bottom, left to right as an homage to the movements of the sun, which is memorialized in a Kapampangan poem.

                    In Kapampangan mythology, the sun god Apung Sinukuan is believed to be the father of Kapampangan civilization. Pangilinan writes that Apung Sinukuan is also known as the god of war, Bayang the destroyer, who appears on the Katipunan flags (which also contain the Baybayin symbol for “Ka”).
