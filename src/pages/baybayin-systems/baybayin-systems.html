            Baybayin does not encompass the entirety of the Philippines’ writing systems. Baybayin is, in fact, only one of a number of writing systems that were in use before the Spanish arrived on our shores. And those in opposition of the bill’s passing worry that relegating one system to the national writing system would erase the diversity of scripts that have and continue to exist around the country, as well as perpetuate a Tagalog-centric national identity.

          <h1>Surat Mangyan</h1>
         <p>
            The Northern Script of the Hanunó'o Mangyan and the Southern Script of the Northern Buhid remain in existence today likely due to the Mangyan’s relative isolation in the mountains of Mindoro. Dutch anthropologist Antoon Postma, who lived with the Hanunó'o Mangyan for many years, is also credited for helping document and preserve their scripts.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are 18 basic syllables: three vowels (a, i, u) and 15 consonants followed by the vowel ‘a’. In Hanunó'o, a diacritic or kudlit written either at the top or on the right of the symbol changes the vowel to ‘i’ and ‘u’ respectively.
         </p>
         <p>
            A “cutting-off” symbol, or pamudpod, was introduced by Postma to eliminate the vowel or indicate a final consonant. Hanunó'o is written vertically from bottom to top and left to right, though it can be read from left to right in horizontal lines. 
         </p>
         <p>
            In Buhid, the accent is placed above or below the symbols and is written left to right horizontally.

            <h1>Tagbanua and Pala’wan</h1>
         <p>
            Similar to the surat Mangyan, the script of the Tagbanua (also known as Tagbanwa) and Pala’wan groups is a syllabic alphabet consisting of three vowels (a, i, u) and 13 consonants accompanied by the letter ‘a.’ The script also makes use of a kudlit written above and below the symbol to indicate a change in vowel. Tagbanua script is written in vertical columns from bottom to top and left to right, and read from left to right in horizontal lines. A small knife called pisaw is used to write the script on wooden slabs and bamboo.
         </p>
         <p>
            The script is believed to have originated among the Tagbanua people, who then introduced the writing to the Pala’wan when Tagbanua workers were taken to Brooke’s Point in Palawan before the second world war. Both groups are said to have recalled the use of their script in relaying messages and asking for basic goods from friends and family in far off places, as well as in signing legal documents, casting their vote during local, provincial, and national elections, and in writing ownership on animals and trees.

          <h1>Kulitan</h1>
          <p>
              Among the other scripts that are being revived by small groups and movements, Kulitan is one of the most interesting scripts, for it is steeped in mythology. In Michael Raymon M. Pangilinan’s book, “An Introduction to Kulitan, The Indigenous Kapampangan Script,” he says the script is written top to bottom, left to right as an homage to the movements of the sun, which is memorialized in a Kapampangan poem.
          </p>
          <p>
              In Kapampangan mythology, the sun god Apung Sinukuan is believed to be the father of Kapampangan civilization. Pangilinan writes that Apung Sinukuan is also known as the god of war, Bayang the destroyer, who appears on the Katipunan flags (which also contain the Baybayin symbol for “Ka”).
